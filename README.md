## Overview
An app to help learner to be **reminded about their academy schedule and the event academy held with notification and alarm** by Summarize all the academy regular schedule and academy event in one app with a reminder feature that will make notif user about what activity will begin in the close time so learner can be more aware about the schedule they have that academy already provide.

## Research

### **Engage** ðŸ¤©

**Big Idea** â†’ Learning **| Essential Question â†’** How do I improve learning in Academy? **| Challenge â†’** Improve my learning in Academy!

### **Investigate** ðŸ”Ž

**Step 1: Guiding Questions**

- How to make a decision easier when discussing with the team?
- How to make a resource documentation list about what we already learned in the academy?
- What did the team do to make a crazy 8 design process better?
- **How to make people attend in academy/event schedule on time?**
- What did you do to help your learning in Academy better?

Result: How to make people attend in academy/event schedule on time?

**Step 2: Findings**

My friend and I sometimes don't put attention to the time which makes us sometimes late to attend the academy on time. Some people who late attend the academy miss the information or the learning materials that they need to catch up with friends or the resource library. Some people miss the events academy held because don't have a schedule in their main academy schedule.

**Step 3: Problem Statements**

I'm solving the problem of the people who did not attend the academy schedule or the event academy held on time so the people will get more attention or reminder about the academy or event schedule.

**Step 4: Solution Concepts**

By Summarize all the academy regular schedule and academy event in one app with a reminder feature that will make notif user about what activity will begin in the close time so learner can be more aware about the schedule they have that academy already provide.

In Future Development I want to add a resource library resource or task list that can make the learner more easier to access to make a note that sync with the calendar from their activity which can make learner more study more easier.

## Visual Design + Prototyping

Because of the short time developing, I made a very simple user interface and more concerned with the main function of the application.

## App Notes + Features 
- Live updates about the schedule that is active at the current time and date, when it is active it will display a notification to the user according to the schedule that is active at that time and date. [Development]
- The schedule list is about a week in scale, the user can see all the schedule lists from the academy and there is a label that separates the regular academy schedule and the event schedule.
- The data set of the schedule is still static so it must be updated manually [Note]
